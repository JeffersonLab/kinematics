# Deep Inelastic Scattering Explained

In DIS, the scattered electron angle $\theta$ is a crucial observable that depends on several variables:
the Bjorken scaling variable $x$, the negative four-momentum transfer squared $Q^{2}$,
and the energies of the electron $E_{e}$ and proton $E_{p}$ beams.

The key variables are the Bjorken scaling variable $x$ and the four-momentum transfer squared $Q^{2}$.

The relation between these variables is given by:

$$
Q^{2} = s x y
$$

where:

- $Q^{2}$ is the negative of the squared four-momentum transfer.
- $s$ is the square of the center-of-mass energy.
- $x$ is the Bjorken scaling variable.
- $y$ is the inelasticity parameter.


**Explanation of the Variables:**

- **\(Q^2\)**: The negative four-momentum transfer squared, defined as \(Q^2 = -q^2\), where \(q\) is the four-momentum transfer between the electron and the proton.
- **\(x\)**: The Bjorken scaling variable, representing the fraction of the proton's momentum carried by the struck quark.
- **\(E_e\)**: The energy of the incident electron beam.
- **\(E_p\)**: The energy of the proton (or ion) beam.
- **\(\theta\)**: The scattering angle of the electron after the collision.

** Scattered Electron Energy $E'_{e}$:

$$
E'_{e} = E_{e} (1 - y)
$$

This expresses the energy of the scattered electron in terms of the initial electron energy and y.

The scattering angle $\theta$ is related to these variables by:


$$
\cos\theta = 1 - \frac{Q^{2}}{2 E_e^{2}\, \left(1 - \frac{Q^{2}}{4 x E_e E_p}\right)}
$$

This visualization helps you understand how changing $x$ and $Q^{2}$ affects the scattering process.
