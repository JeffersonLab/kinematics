# Deep Inelastic Scattering

In DIS, the scattered electron angle $\theta$ is a crucial observable that depends on several variables:
the Bjorken scaling variable $x$, the negative four-momentum transfer squared $Q^{2}$,
and the energies of the electron $E_{e}$ and proton $E_{p}$ beams.

This visualization shows how energy $x$ and $Q^{2}$ affects the scattering process.

The key variables are the Bjorken scaling variable $x$ and the four-momentum transfer squared $Q^{2}$.

The relation between these variables is given by:

$$
Q^{2} = s x y
$$

where:

- $Q^{2}$: The negative four-momentum transfer squared, defined as $Q^{2} = -q^{2}$, where $q$ is the four-momentum transfer between the electron and the proton.
- $s$: The square of the center-of-mass energy.
- $x$: The Bjorken scaling variable, representing the fraction of the proton's momentum carried by the struck quark.
- $y$: The inelasticity parameter. It expresses the energy of the scattered electron in terms of the initial electron energy as $E'_{e} = E_{e} (1 - y)$

The scattering angle $\theta$ is related to these variables by:

$$
\cos\theta = 1 - \frac{Q^{2}}{2 E_e^{2}\, \left(1 - \frac{Q^{2}}{4 x E_e E_p}\right)}
$$

Where $E_{e}$ the energy of the incident electron beam and $E_p$ of the proton (or ion) beam.
